# Statistic Reports
In this repository, I have posted three statistical essays. They pertain to machine learning, specifically:
  1) PCA and Regression
  2) Clustering
  3) Time Series

I used three different datasets. The professor requested datasets from non-classical sources. He prohibited websites like UCI and Kaggle. Finding the right dataset on which to perform these technical methodologies has been quite challenging, perhaps the most difficult part of the work (lol).

The course was in Italian, so the reports are also in Italian.
